Turn based engine
Entities following the path
Placing towers
Towers shooting at entities
    - Need to work out how that's going to work in a turn based game
        - Probably best to just make projectiles non-turn based?
        - Might work if projectiles firing is part of the players turn
            - As long as the projectiles move quickly

Money system for buying towers
EXP system for unlocking new towers/upgrades
Upgrades should be based on using towers
    - E.g. X kills with a tower gives you an upgrade for it
